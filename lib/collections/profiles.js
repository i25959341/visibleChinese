His craftsmanship and designs soon became noticed and he came to the verge of international fame when his creations were featured in a record eight pages in a 1988 issue of Vogue magazine. Patronage from Diana, Princess of Wales from 1990 onwards further boosted his image. In 1996, he co-founded Jimmy Choo Ltd with UK Vogue accessories editor Tamara Mellon. \\nIn April 2001, Choo sold his 50% stake in the company for £10 million.
